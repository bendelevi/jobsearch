A retool app to keep track of my applications, generate resumes and analyze my applications

I started applying for jobs and realized that I am applying for the same jobs again or I forget the answers I give to the questions in the application during the interview.
I decided to build an app using retool to keep track of my applications.
I used the retool database which leverages a PostgreSQL DB.
I also used some of the new features like the OpenAI integration to enhance the features.
